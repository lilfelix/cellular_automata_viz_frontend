If you have no idea what OpenGL is, this is a good place to start.

Visualizing the social fabric as the skin of the organism that is society.
Neural network with hot spots. How activity in a region is interpreted as a visualization depends on the sentiment analysis done on the data causing the 
excitatory or inhibitory activity.

By zooming into a hot spot, like `Camera panning objects in space` example above,
You could read the corresponding tweets, news articles, youtube clips, podcasts, radio announcements etc.
Defense (FÃ¶rsvar) intelligence system?
In a crisis, the defense ought to have a channel open in all different media,
and tap into what people are requesting. This could help people self-triage in
the event of a crisis.

1. Department sends clear instrutions via all its channels on how to contact them, allowing auto-triaging.
2. If a department can scan fb,twter,reddit etc for people responding using this format, the pre-triage would be complete, and the department can reach out/help people in a better order than random.
