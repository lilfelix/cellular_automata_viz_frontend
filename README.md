## Proto


[See docs for unintuitive use of `js_out`](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf-javascript?tab=readme-ov-file#the---js_out-flag)
```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$PWD/node_modules/protoc-gen-js/bin
protoc --js_out=$PWD/src/proto/generated --proto_path=$PWD/src/proto/ $PWD/src/proto/sim_server.proto
``` 
with gRPC services:
```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$PWD/node_modules/protoc-gen-js/bin
protoc --js_out=import_style=commonjs:$PWD/src/proto/generated \
    --proto_path=$PWD/src/proto/ $PWD/src/proto/sim_server.proto \
    --grpc-web_out=import_style=commonjs,mode=grpcwebtext:$PWD/src/proto/generated
``` 

## gRPC

Use [grpc-web](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-web) via `npm i grpc-web`.
It's a JavaScript implementation of gRPC for browser clients. Intallstion instructions [here](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-web?tab=readme-ov-file#code-generator-plugins)


This is server side:
`@grpc/grpc-js` from https://github.com/grpc/grpc-node

Visualizing the social fabric as the skin of the organism that is society.
Neural network with hot spots. How activity in a region is interpreted as a visualization depends on the sentiment analysis done on the data causing the 
excitatory or inhibitory activity.

By zooming into a hot spot, like `Level of Detail` and `Camera panning objects in space` examples above,
You could read the corresponding tweets, news articles, youtube clips, podcasts, radio announcements etc.
Defense (FÃ¶rsvar) intelligence system?
In a crisis, the defense ought to have a channel open in all different media,
and tap into what people are requesting. This could help people self-triage in
the event of a crisis.

1. Department sends clear instrutions via all its channels on how to contact them, allowing auto-triaging.
2. If a department can scan fb,twter,reddit etc for people responding using this format, the pre-triage would be complete, and the department can reach out/help people in a better order than random.
